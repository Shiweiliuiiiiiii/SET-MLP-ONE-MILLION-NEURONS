# About
Code associated with paper "Sparse evolutionary Deep Learning with over one million artificial neurons on commodity hardware" published in Neural Computing and Applications.

This is a pre-alpha free software and was tested in Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5.2, Numpy 1.14, SciPy 0.19.1, and (optionally) Cython 0.27.3;
The code will be refactored, more comments will be added, and will be made available online after the acceptance of the paper.
# Running
